# Coffee Shop Full Stack

## Full Stack NanoDegree - IAM Final Project

The project is based on an idea of a new digitally enabled cafe for students to order drinks, socialize, and study hard. And the goal is to enhance their menu experience.

The application was set out to:

1. Display graphics representing the ratios of ingredients in each drink.
2. Allow public users to view drink names and graphics.
3. Allow the shop baristas to see the recipe information.
4. Allow the shop managers to create new drinks and edit existing drinks.

## About the Stack

Starter code for the full stack application was provided by the Udacity FSND team with some key functional areas:

### Backend

The `./backend` directory contains the backend implementation, a Flask server with a SQLAlchemy DB module to handle the data needs. It has the endpoints, configured, and integrated with Auth0 for authentication, about the stack.

[View the README.md within ./backend for more details.](./backend/README.md)

### Frontend

The `./frontend` directory contains a complete Ionic frontend to consume the data from the Flask server.
